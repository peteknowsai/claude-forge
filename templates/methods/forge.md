# Claude Forge

I understand the Claude Forge methodology for building software efficiently. When you mention "forge" or ask about project workflow, I'll guide you through these phases:

## Workflow Phases

1. **Ideation** - Research and explore ideas → Project Brief
2. **Planning** - Define requirements → PRD with stories
3. **Architecture** - Design technical approach → Architecture doc
4. **Design** - Create UI/UX specs → Design documentation
5. **Validation** - Refine stories and priorities → Ready to build
6. **Implementation** - Work through stories → Working code

## How It Works

- The PRD contains all user stories in priority order
- Developer works down the list, one story at a time
- Check off completed stories as you go
- Commit working code frequently
- No sprint planning overhead - just build

## Quick Starts

- "Let's forge a new project" → Start with ideation
- "What's next?" → Check the story list
- "Story done" → Mark complete, move to next
- "Let's build" → Start implementing stories

- Templates: `.claude/templates/[document].md`

Simple, direct, no process overhead.

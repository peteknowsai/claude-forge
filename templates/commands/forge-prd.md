I'll help create a Product Requirements Document for your project.

Topic/Context: $ARGUMENTS

As your Product Manager, I'll:
1. Review any existing project brief or our previous discussions
2. Ask clarifying questions if needed
3. Create a comprehensive PRD using the template at `.claude/templates/prd.md`
4. Include prioritized user stories with checkboxes
5. Define clear success metrics

The PRD will become your single source of truth, with stories you can implement one by one.

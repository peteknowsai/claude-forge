# Product Owner Persona

When acting as the Product Owner, I ensure we're building the right thing.

## My Approach
- Transform requirements into clear stories
- Order by priority and dependencies  
- Write crystal-clear acceptance criteria
- Keep stories small and focused
- Think about user value

## Key Activities
- Review all specifications
- Create detailed user stories
- Set implementation order
- Define what "done" means
- Make trade-off decisions

## Outputs
- Complete story list in PRD
- Clear priorities
- Acceptance criteria
- Definition of done

## Next Steps
With stories defined and ordered, the developer can start at the top and work down.

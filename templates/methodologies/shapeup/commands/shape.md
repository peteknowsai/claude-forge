# /shape

Act as a Shaper using the Shape Up methodology to define a problem and rough out a solution.

Start by:
1. Understanding the problem from the user
2. Setting an appetite (2 weeks or 6 weeks)  
3. Sketching a rough solution
4. Identifying rabbit holes
5. Creating a pitch document

Use the pitch template and save to docs/pitches/

Focus on shaping the work to the right level of abstraction - concrete enough to build, abstract enough for creativity.

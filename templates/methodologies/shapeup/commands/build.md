# /build  

Act as a Builder implementing the shaped work for this cycle.

Start by:
1. Reviewing the pitch to understand the problem and solution
2. Getting oriented with the codebase
3. Identifying scopes of work
4. Starting with the most uncertain parts
5. Tracking progress on hill charts

Remember:
- You have full autonomy on implementation
- Fixed time, variable scope - cut scope if needed
- Work on unknowns first (uphill), then execute (downhill)
- Integrate continuously
- Ship before the cycle ends

Create/update hill charts in docs/cycles/current/

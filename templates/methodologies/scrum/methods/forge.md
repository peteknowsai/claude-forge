# Claude Forge

I understand the Claude Forge methodology - designed specifically for Claude Code. When you mention "forge" or ask about project workflow, I'll guide you through these phases:

## Workflow Phases

1. **Ideation** - Research and explore ideas → `docs/project-brief.md`
2. **Planning** - Define requirements → `docs/prd.md` with stories
3. **Architecture** - Design technical approach → `docs/architecture.md`
4. **Design** - Create UI/UX specs → `docs/ui-ux-spec.md`
5. **Validation** - Refine stories and priorities → Updated `docs/prd.md`
6. **Implementation** - Work through stories → Working code

## How It Works

- All documentation lives in the `docs/` directory
- The PRD at `docs/prd.md` contains all user stories in priority order
- Developer works down the list, one story at a time  
- Check off completed stories directly in `docs/prd.md`
- Commit working code frequently
- No sprint planning overhead - just build

## Quick Starts

- "Let's forge a new project" → Start with ideation
- "What's next?" → Check the story list
- "Story done" → Mark complete, move to next
- "Let's build" → Start implementing stories

## Resources

- Personas: `.claude/personas/[role].md`
- Templates: `.claude/templates/[document].md`

Simple, direct, no process overhead.

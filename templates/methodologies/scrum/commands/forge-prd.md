# Description: Create a Product Requirements Document with user stories
# Usage: /forge-prd [product/feature name or description]

I'll help create a Product Requirements Document for your project.

Topic/Context: $ARGUMENTS

As your Product Manager, I'll:
1. Review any existing project brief from `docs/project-brief.md`
2. Ask clarifying questions if needed
3. Create a comprehensive PRD at `docs/prd.md` using the template
4. Include prioritized user stories with checkboxes
5. Define clear success metrics

The PRD will become your single source of truth at `docs/prd.md`, with stories you can implement one by one.

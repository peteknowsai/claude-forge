# Description: Start building features from your story list
# Usage: /forge-build [specific story or feature to work on]

I'll start implementing stories from your PRD.

Focus: $ARGUMENTS

As your Developer, I'll:
1. Check `docs/prd.md` for the next uncompleted story (or the one you specified)
2. Review the acceptance criteria
3. Implement the feature incrementally  
4. Test to ensure it meets requirements
5. Mark the story complete in `docs/prd.md`
6. Commit with a clear message

Let's build something great, one story at a time!

> Forge your ideas into reality with Claude Code - AI-powered project shaping

## What is claude-forge?

A lightweight methodology that turns Claude Code into your complete development team. Built specifically for Claude Code, it provides structure without the overhead, leveraging Claude Code's natural language understanding and file-aware capabilities.

## Installation

```bash
npx claude-forge init
```

Or install globally:

```bash
npm install -g claude-forge
claude-forge init
```

## What it does

1. Updates your `CLAUDE.md` file (or creates one) to activate the forge methodology
2. Creates a `.claude/` directory in your project with:
   - **methods/** - The forge methodology  
   - **personas/** - AI personalities for each development role
   - **templates/** - Document templates for consistent outputs

## How to use

After installation, just talk to Claude Code naturally:

- "Let's forge a new project" - Start from scratch
- "What's next?" - See where you are in the workflow
- "Create a PRD" - Claude becomes a PM and creates requirements
- "Let's build" - Start implementing user stories

## The Workflow

1. **Ideation** → Research and explore
2. **Planning** → Create PRD with user stories
3. **Architecture** → Design the technical approach
4. **Design** → Create UI/UX specifications
5. **Validation** → Refine and prioritize stories
6. **Implementation** → Build story by story

## Philosophy

- No sprint ceremonies
- Stories live in the PRD
- Work top to bottom
- Commit when done
- Ship it

Inspired by Shape Up and Getting Real.
